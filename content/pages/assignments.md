Below are some student examples of presentations and game designs. Students who took the fall seminar, [11.941](/courses/11-941-use-of-joint-fact-finding-in-science-intensive-policy-disputes-part-i-fall-2003), have the opportunity to present their papers at a symposium at USGS headquarters. The role-play simulation may be published as part of a joint USGS/MIT working paper series.
